# Authentications
In this project you can find a simple representation of single-factor and two-factor authentications.
The methods and classes are over-simplified for the purpose of insisting on the logic behind the factor rather than the correctness of the code.

If you have found any mistake or you want to update the code, feel free to open an  issue or collaborate. I'll happily review and accept your pull requests.
